title: Get involved
---
# OpenBeta is more than sharing climbing route beta, itâ€™s an open source project. **You can help.**

## Four primary ways you can get involved

- Participate in the development of the OpenBeta platform itself.  This includes the climbing route catalog (under active development), the climbing route Geocoder API and related subprojects.
- Help improve the catalog content, write descriptions for climbing areas, and make corrections to existing content.
- Use the climbing dataset in your project.  Build anything you want.
- Contribute a guest post on openbeta.io/blog.
