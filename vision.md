# The OpenBeta Vision

**The OpenBeta Foundation is a grassroots initiative to empower and engage climbers toward free and open information, collaboration, and innovation.**

## Free & Open Information

The OpenBeta platform is a new avenue for climbers to share and receive free climbing beta. We set up the project within a nonprofit foundation so that it would always serve the climbing community, rather than investors and shareholders.

We pledge to keep climbers' generous contribution free and open, and without legal restrictions preventing people from using the information in creative and productive ways.

## Collaboration

The OpenBeta API will serve to provide rock climbing information...

## Innovation

The OpenBeta Foundation will work hard within the community to find funding to provide grants to developers looking to build innovation for the climbing community as technology becomes more prevalent world wide.
