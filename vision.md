# The OpenBeta Vision

From campfire stories, to endless stoke, to creative beta - We believe that sharing information, collaborating together, and innovating runs within our blood (occasionally left on walls).

We also believe that technology is reaching into every corner of our lives, and over the past decade we've seen it impacting climbing. We've watched as social media companies collect and sell our data, shove ads in our face, and monetize us for billions.

Open collaboration is the future. In the 90’s, the software industry and digital creative community faced the same crossroads, and created open licenses to foster collaboration and maximize participation in the digital age. Examples where “open-data” (data that anyone can access, use, or share) is published to benefit the greater community: Wikipedia, World Health Organization, United States Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap.

## The OpenBeta Foundation is a grassroots initiative to empower and engage climbers toward free & open information, collaboration, and innovation.

Initially, we are targeting three major projects working toward this initiative:

1. **Free & Open Information** - The OpenBeta platform is a new avenue for climbers to share and receive free climbing beta. We set up the project within a nonprofit foundation so that it would always serve the climbing community, rather than investors and shareholders. We pledge to keep climbers' generous contribution free and open, and without legal restrictions preventing people from using the information in creative and productive ways.

2. **Collaboration** - The OpenBeta API will serve to provide rock climbing information...

3. **Innovation** - The OpenBeta Foundation will work hard within the community to find funding to provide grants to developers looking to build innovation for the climbing community as technology becomes more prevalent world wide.
